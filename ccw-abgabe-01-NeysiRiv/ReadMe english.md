# Submission 1

## Website for a Chocolate Factory

In this exercise, you will design a website. You can continue working on the project from the second session or start a new one. Use HTML and CSS to create a simple yet structured and stylish webpage, ensuring semantic correctness and consistent design.

It is also possible to choose a different theme than a chocolate factory; however, it is essential that all the following requirements are met.

### Task Instructions

1.	Create the HTML Basic Structure - Set up the semantic structure of the webpage:
	- Define the structure using `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
	- Use semantic HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` to structure the page.
2.	Headlines and Navigation
	- Use headlines (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) appropriately, organizing them according to the page’s hierarchy.
	- Create a navigation bar with links (`<a>`) to the different sections of the website, such as “About Us,” “Products,” and “Contact.”
3.	Embed Images
	- Add images to the webpage that showcase products or other thematically fitting elements. Save the images in a dedicated folder (e.g., images) to maintain an organized folder structure.
4.	Create Lists
	- Create an ordered list (e.g., `<ol>`) for ordered items, such as steps in a process or product ingredients.
	- Create an unordered list (e.g., `<ul>`) for items that don’t require a specific order, such as various products or categories.
5.	Style with CSS
	- Use an external CSS stylesheet and link it to your HTML file.
6.	Selectors, Pseudo-elements, and Pseudo-classes
	- Use the universal selector (*), type selectors (e.g., p, h1), and class selectors (.class) to apply various styles.
	- Apply combined selectors, such as .class > p or .nav li, for more specific styling.
	- Use pseudo-elements like ::before and ::after to add decorative elements, and ::first-letter to style the first letter of a paragraph.
	- Use the pseudo-class :hover to change the appearance of navigation links when hovered over.
7.	Typography and Spacing
	- Integrate two different font families (e.g., via Google Fonts) and use them for different areas of the page.
	- Apply font properties (font-family, font-size, font-weight, etc.) and border settings (border, border-radius) to style text and images.
	- Define padding and margin to structure the page layout.
8.	Layout
	- Use Flexbox to arrange elements (e.g., for navigation, a product overview, etc.).
	- Apply the object-fit property to ensure images fit well within containers of various sizes.
	- Choose a color scheme using a color wheel and adhere to it when designing the webpage.
	- Document the chosen color codes as comments in the CSS stylesheet.
